# Font size in points. This value can be a non-integer and the nearest integer
# pixel size will be selected. If you have a high dpi display where 1pt = 2px
# then you can get an odd numbered pixel size by specifying a half point.
#
# For example, 13.5pt @ 2px/pt = 27px
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals,
# i.e. new windows, tabs, etc. Note that you may still not see the change
# depending on your `window-inherit-font-size` setting. If that setting is
# true, only the first window will be affected by this change since all
# subsequent windows will inherit the font size of the previous window.

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of the background. A value of
# 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. A value less than 0
# or greater than 1 will be clamped to the nearest valid value.
#
# On macOS, background opacity is disabled when the terminal enters native
# fullscreen. This is because the background becomes gray and it can cause
# widgets to show through which isn't generally desirable.
background-opacity = 1

# The initial window size. This size is in terminal grid cells by default.
# Both values must be set to take effect. If only one value is set, it is
# ignored.
#
# We don't currently support specifying a size in pixels but a future change
# can enable that. If this isn't specified, the app runtime will determine
# some default size.
#
# Note that the window manager may put limits on the size or override the
# size. For example, a tiling window manager may force the window to be a
# certain size to fit within the grid. There is nothing Ghostty will do about
# this, but it will make an effort.
#
# Sizes larger than the screen size will be clamped to the screen size.
# This can be used to create a maximized-by-default window size.
#
# This will not affect new tabs, splits, or other nested terminal elements.
# This only affects the initial window size of any new window. Changing this
# value will not affect the size of the window after it has been created. This
# is only used for the initial size.
#
# BUG: On Linux with GTK, the calculated window size will not properly take
# into account window decorations. As a result, the grid dimensions will not
# exactly match this configuration. If window decorations are disabled (see
# window-decorations), then this will work as expected.
#
# Windows smaller than 10 wide by 4 high are not allowed.
